## From CSV to Google Calendar, for all my planting needs

We organize our garden plans every year in a spreadsheet, but it's a chore to then add the dates to my online calendars, or share schedules with other local gardeners. So, here's a cute little parser to get the job done. Maybe one day it will have it's own cute little CLI, where I could select the filepath and add the appropriate Google credentials.

Currently not using the Google API, but instead manually entering the data using google_calendar gem, but would like to use the API in the future to ensure things get posted (instead of my post-and-check methods right now).
